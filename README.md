# NvimSetup

This is my Neovim setup.

## How to set up for mac

- Install Neovim
- Make sure you have a true color terminal installed. For mac I use iTerm2
- Download the code to your **_.config/nvim_** folder in your home directory
- If it does not take effect by itself, run `:source %` in Neovim
- To reload/update plugins, save plugins-setup.lua
